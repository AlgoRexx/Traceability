# Date Query

- Open the "**Trace9.py**" file.
- Locate line 90 and update the folder path to the absolute path of the "date_query" folder on your system.
- After adjusting the path, open a terminal in the same directory and execute the following command to launch the application using UVicorn : uvicorn Trace9:app --reload

## Examples : 
- On typing **28/03/23** => we get the all rows that match date.
